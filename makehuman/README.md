# MakeHuman

MakeHuman: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/

I made the following modifications on the model:
- modified the body shape
- added Metarig and Rigify
- splitted the teeth into an upper part and a lower part
- modified the shader of the eyeballs
- modified the shader of the hair to increase its Gamma value 
- disabled shadow on the hair
