# MakeHuman

## MPFB (MakeHuman Plugin For Blender)

As a Blender user, I find MPFB is a lot easier to use than MakeHuman as standalone software.

## The first model I generated with Makehuman

I generated a woman model with MakeHuman on Windows10 PC. After that, I imported the model into Blender and manually rigged the model with Rigify.

I made the following modifications on the model:
- modified the body shape
- added Metarig and Rigify
- splitted the teeth into an upper part and a lower part
- modified the shader of the eyeballs
- modified the shader of the hair to increase its Gamma value 
- disabled shadow on the hair
