### Fisheye Equisolid 250 degrees

The other day, I visited a shooting location where a 240-degree panoramic video was being filmed using the combination of [Entaniya H250](https://products.entaniya.co.jp/en/list/hal-250-series/) and [Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K (with OLPF)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicursaminipro) cameras. Below is a simulation of the shooting using a combination of a Fisheye 250-degree lens and an 8K image sensor.
