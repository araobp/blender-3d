## Fisheye Equisolid 250 degrees

The other day, I visited a shooting location where a 240-degree panoramic video was being filmed using the combination of Entaniya H250 and Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K cameras. Below is a simulation of the shooting using a Fisheye 250-degree lens and an 8K image sensor combination.
