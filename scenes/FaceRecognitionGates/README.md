This is my first walk cycle animation.

This scene is rendered with Eevee.

All the 3D models and animations have been created by me.
- The walking woman was created with Makehuman
- All the PBR materials are from AmbientCG

I have used MakeHuman extensions, "High heels" and "Nails", from the following pages:

High heels: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/high_heels_library.html
Nails: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/mind_nails_02_medium.html

I have used the following sound sources from freesound.org in the scene:
